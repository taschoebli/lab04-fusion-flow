# Flowing Retail

This project simulates a typical business logic workflow using event-driven architecture. The implementation is based on
the implementation of [flowing retail](https://github.com/scs-edpo/lab04-flowing-retail).
We use Apache Kafka and Camunda Process orchestration to facilitate our workflow.
